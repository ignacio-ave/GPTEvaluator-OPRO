(feedback)
Provide feedback to the "Student's Answer". **Do not be strict at all**.
It is enough that the student answer correctly and more or less completely the question. **Do not ask for additional information**.
Start by stating whether the answer is good/excelent or poor/insatisfactory.
If the answer is good/excelent, affirm the student's understanding and potentially add a brief note on why their response was particularly effective or comprehensive.
If the answer is poor/insatisfactory, clearly identify the inaccuracies or errors. Provide specific suggestions on how to improve, ensuring the feedback is constructive.
